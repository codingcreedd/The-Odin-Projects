        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Cook the Fettuccine:</b><br>
            Boil a large pot of salted water and cook the fettuccine pasta according to package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Season and Cook the Chicken:</b><br>
            Season the chicken slices with salt and black pepper. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken until it's no longer pink in the center and has a golden-brown exterior. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Prepare the Creamy Alfredo Sauce:</b><br>
            In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and saut√© for a minute until fragrant. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Add the butter, heavy cream, and grated Parmesan cheese. Stir continuously until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth and creamy. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Combine Chicken and Pasta:</b><br>
            Add the cooked chicken slices to the Alfredo sauce, stirring gently to coat the chicken in the creamy goodness. Let it simmer for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Serve:</b><br>
            Pour the chicken Alfredo sauce over the cooked fettuccine pasta. Toss everything together until the pasta is well-coated in the sauce. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Garnish and Enjoy: </b><br>
            Serve the Chicken Alfredo Pasta hot, garnished with additional Parmesan cheese and a sprinkle of fresh parsley. Pair it with a side of garlic bread or a crisp salad for a complete and satisfying meal.
