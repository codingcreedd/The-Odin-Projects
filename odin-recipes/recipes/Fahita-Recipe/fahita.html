    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Lebanese seven-spice blend (a mix of allspice, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, fenugreek, ginger, and black pepper)</li>
        <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large red bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped, for garnish</li>
        <li>Warm Lebanese flatbreads or pita for serving</li>
        <li>Avocado</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Marinate the Chicken:</b><br>
            In a bowl, combine the thinly sliced chicken with olive oil, Lebanese seven-spice blend, lemon juice, minced garlic, ground cumin, salt, and pepper. Ensure each slice is well coated. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.</li>
        <li>
            <b>Sauté the Chicken:</b><br>
            Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the marinated chicken slices and cook until they are golden brown and cooked through. This should take about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Sauté the Vegetables:</b><br>
            In the same skillet, add a bit more olive oil if needed. Toss in the sliced bell peppers and onions. Sauté until they are tender-crisp, retaining a bit of crunch. The vibrant colors should complement the flavors.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Combine and Serve:</b><br>
            Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the sautéed vegetables. Toss everything together until well combined and heated through. Adjust seasoning if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Garnish and Serve:</b><br>
            Sprinkle freshly chopped parsley over the fajita mixture. Warm the Lebanese flatbreads or pita, and serve them alongside the chicken and vegetable mixture. Allow everyone to create their own wraps, savoring the delicious fusion of Lebanese spices and Tex-Mex flair.
